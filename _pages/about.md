Hi! I am a PhD student in Political Science at the University of Washington, Seattle. Before joining UW, I earned my MA in Political Science from Sabancı University (2025) and my BA in Political Science and International Relations from Boğaziçi University (2023).

My main research interests involve comparative politics and political methodology. I am interested in repression, violence, and autocratization with a focus on historical legacies and quantitative methods. My current work rethinks how we measure and understand autocrats' repertoires of repression.
