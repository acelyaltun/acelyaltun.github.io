[This thesis examines the effect of threat perception on protest repression by focusing
on protest and repression dynamics in Turkey during democratic backsliding.
Questioning when and against whom protest repression is more intense, it seeks
to understand the determinants of state response to dissent. However, traditional
media sourcing and news outlets’ coverage are insufficient in non-democratic settings
where the media is co-opted, censored, and heavily repressed, which requires
addressing additional causes of selection bias. To address this problem, I construct
and leverage a unique dataset based on human rights reports. The TRACE dataset
measures protest and repression events in Turkey since 2013 with fine-grained event
categorization and issue type identification. The comparison with other protest
event datasets illustrates TRACE’s strength in measuring protest repression across
different issues in Turkey. To analyze changes in protest repression behavior across
various issue types, I employ multinomial logistic regression. Results show that the
intensity of protest repression increases with the perceived threat. Further, mobilization
becomes more threatening to the regime when it is challenged by labor
and environmental issues. Ultimately, this thesis aims to provide more insight into
targeted protest repression and threat perceptions in non-democratic regimes.]
