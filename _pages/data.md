## TRACE 

- **Turkey Repression and Contentious Events Dataset (2013-2025)**

TRACE measures contention, repression, and protest intervention in Turkey at the event level. Covering the last 12 years of authoritarian
transition in Turkey, it accounts for various types of repression, provides an expanded protest repression measurement, and a context-driven 
issue categorization. By differentiating between police blocking demonstrations, intervening with brute force and tear gas, and detention of 
protestors, TRACE allows for observing changes in protest repression behavior. Moreover, it provides issue type identification necessary to 
compare state response to different movements.
